For example, by helping competitors in their testing and speaking, my goal and responsibility is to properly equip them with all the experience, knowledge, and strategies that I have learned and have implemented both as an individual and teammate.", img_name: "akshat")

Competing has taught me so much about business, public speaking and stress management.
